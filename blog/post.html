  <p> RBD Engineers Pvt. Ltd. is a company manufacturing precision clutch components. They use a sand-casting process for the manufacturing of casting parts. They use sand as the mold material. At present trolley carts and rail are used to transfer mold carts from one place to another. The layout of the rails is constructed such that it acts as a continuous sequential system. Therefore, this current system requires lots of workers to do monotonous work and time taken for the material handling process is also more which may reduce the productivity of foundry. </p>

<p> In order to meet the rising demands; an automated and optimized system is to be designed that moves the mold carts from mold station to knock-off station. The system must be developed in a manner that it will be cost-effective and will take care of size-limitations.</p>

        <p>Initially, a conveyor system with a customized fixture (semi-hook like) was developed to move the carts. In this mechanism, a fixture would be used to push the mold carts which will be attached on the chain of the conveyor at regular intervals. These fixtures would come in contact from the beneath the carts. Due to which, the whole conveyor mechanism is to be installed below the rails i.e., below the ground level. The shape of the fixture was made such that it can easily slide and come in contact with the cart and can also be detached easily. The system was suitable as per the requirements; however, the foundry has to undergo maintenance for a few days during the installation of the mechanism, which is not feasible option from the foundry’s perspective. Also, it would require digging some trenches and due to the rugged environment of foundry, frequent maintenance of chain conveyor may be required. In order to rectify maintenance issues, few modifications were suggested which eventually increased the overall manufacturing cost of the mechanism which may not allow small-scale industries to opt for the developed mechanism. </p>
 
       <p> Later, a mechanism was developed and proposed which works on the principle of Rack and Pinion. In this mechanism, the motor will be mounted on the linear slider (platform) having a pinion attached at the motor shaft which will be meshing with the rack of linear guide-way; due to which the platform will slide on the guide-way. In order to push the mold-cart, actuation using lead screw was considered to be placed on the platform such that when the shaft mounted on the leadscrew is extended, it would come in contact at the back portion of the mold-cart and will push the mold-cart and when no contact is needed, the shaft would be retracted. This mechanism will be placed parallel to the mold cart rail line and requires minimal installation set-up which could be beneficial from an industrial point of view.</p>

       <p>The mechanism works totally based on the feedback of sensors. The algorithm is developed in such a manner; distance sensors placed on the platform facing towards the mold cart rail will detect if mold cart has arrived or not. Once the mold cart is aligned properly and sensors detect it, the motor will drive the leadscrew actuator and the pushing rod attached on the leadscrew will extend. Then after the main motor will drive the pinion and as a result the platform will slide on the linear guideway. Proximity sensor is attached at the probe which detects the already placed mold carts on the rails and signals to stop the main motor and as a result the mold carts will be lined-up in similar fashion. Meanwhile after placing the mold cart, the leadscrew retracts and the main motor will rotate in the opposite direction taking the platform at its home position. Limit switches are placed on the platform and small blocks are placed on the guideway which signifies the home position and max travel position; when the platform passes over the small block, the switch is pressed and it stops the platform. While unloading the mold cart, the on-field operator has to give command in the form of pressing the switch and then it will perform the task of unloading the mold carts. Safety features such as obstacle detection and emergency stop are provided in order to avoid any hazard.</p>

       <p>The proposed mechanism may prove to be significant from a small scale industry’s point of view who wants an upgrade to a semi-automated system which occupies less space on the factory floor, requires less setup and is cost effective.</p>
